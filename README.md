  * Forensic Psychology, 4th edition is a market-leading Canadian text that provides stimulating and accessible course materials by pioneers in the field. The authors have taken a broad-based perspective that incorporates both experimental and clinical topics. The text covers topics that might otherwise be discussed in traditional social and cognitive psychology courses–including eyewitness testimony, jury decision making, and police procedures–as well as topics that are clinical in nature and might otherwise be discussed in traditional personality or abnormal psychology courses–such as the meaning of being unfit to stand trial, mentally disordered offenders, and psychopathy. The authors’ goal in this edition was to update important ideas, issues, and research in a way that students will understand and enjoy, and in some cases find useful in their professional careers.
